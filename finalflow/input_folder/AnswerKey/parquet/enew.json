      "1.1": "If XCl ₂ is the chloride, then metal X has valency 2. Therefore: ● Sulphate formula: XSO ₄ ● Hydroxide formula: X(OH) ₂",
      "1.2": "If XN is the nitride, metal X has valency 3 (since nitrogen has valency 3). Therefore: i) Sulphate formula: X ₂ (SO ₄ ) ₃ ii) Hydroxide formula: X(OH) ₃",
      "1.3": "Valency of nitrogen in: i) NO: +2 ii) N ₂ O: +1 iii) NO ₂ : +4 Additional Questions",
      "2.1": "a) Three metals whose symbols are derived from first letter of their name: ● Boron (B) ● Carbon (C) ● Potassium (K) b) Three metals whose symbols are derived from Latin names: ● Gold (Au from Aurum) ● Silver (Ag from Argentum) ● Iron (Fe from Ferrum)",
      "2.2": "Eight metals showing variable valency: 1. Iron (Fe): +2, +3 2. Copper (Cu): +1, +2 3. Mercury (Hg): +1, +2 4. Tin (Sn): +2, +4 5. Lead (Pb): +2, +4 6. Gold (Au): +1, +3 7. Chromium (Cr): +2, +3, +6 8. Manganese (Mn): +2, +3, +4, +6, +7 Valency of sulphur in: a) SO ₂ : +4 b) SO ₃ : +6",
      "2.3": "Examples of chemical equations: a) One product: 2H ₂ + O ₂ → 2H ₂ O b) Two ₃ → CaO + CO ₂ c) Three products: 4HNO ₃ → 2H ₂ O + 4NO ₂ + O ₂ d) Four products: 2KClO → 2KCl + 2O ₂ + O ₂ + Heat products: CaCO products: 2KClO ₃",
