      "1A": "If XCl ₂ is the chloride, then metal X has valency 2. Therefore: - ● Sulphate formula: XSO ₄ - ● Hydroxide formula: X(OH) ₂",
      "1B": "If XN is the nitride, metal X has valency 3 (since nitrogen has valency 3). Therefore: i) Sulphate formula: X ₂ (SO ₄ ) ₃ ii) Hydroxide formula: X(OH) ₃ - i)",
      "1C": "Valency of nitrogen in: i) NO: +2 ii) N ₂ O: +1 iii) NO ₂ : +4 Additional Questions",
      "2A": "a) Three metals whose symbols are derived from first letter of their name: - ● Boron (B) - ● Carbon (C) - ● Potassium (K) b) Three metals whose symbols are derived from Latin names: - ● Gold (Au from Aurum) - ● Silver (Ag from Argentum) - ● Iron (Fe from Ferrum)",
      "2B": "Eight metals showing variable valency: - 1. Iron (Fe): +2, +3 - 2. Copper (Cu): +1, +2 - 3. Mercury (Hg): +1, +2 - 4. Tin (Sn): +2, +4 - 5. Lead (Pb): +2, +4 - 6. Gold (Au): +1, +3 - 7. Chromium (Cr): +2, +3, +6 - 8. Manganese (Mn): +2, +3, +4, +6, +7 Valency of sulphur in: a) SO ₂ : +4 b) SO ₃ : +6",
      "2C": "Examples of chemical equations: a) One product: 2H ₂ + O ₂ → 2H ₂ O b) Two products: CaCO ₃ → CaO + CO ₂ c) Three products: 4HNO ₃ → 2H ₂ O + 4NO ₂ + O ₂ d) Four products: 2KClO ₃ → 2KCl + 2O ₂ + O ₂ + Heat",
      "2D": "Symbols in chemical equations mean: i) ↑ - Gas evolved ii) ↓ - Precipitate formed iii) (s) - Solid state iv) (l) - Liquid state v) (g) - Gaseous state vi) (aq) - Aqueous solution"
