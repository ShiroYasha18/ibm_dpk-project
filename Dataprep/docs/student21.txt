Answer: 

Conflicting requirements are a common challenge in software projects, especially when multiple stakeholders have different priorities. These conflicts can occur between functional requirements (what the system does) and non-functional requirements (how the system performs, e.g., usability, security, scalability). Resolving such conflicts requires a structured approach to balance business objectives and quality expectations. 

Key Steps to Resolve Conflicting Requirements: 

1. Analyze the Root Cause of Conflict 

Understand why conflict exists. Typical reasons include: 

Differing Priorities: One stakeholder values functionality, while another prioritizes performance or security. 

Varying Perspectives: Stakeholders may have divergent views on the project's purpose and scope. 

Example: A marketing team might request an interactive, user-friendly interface (functional), while a security team demands strict controls to ensure data privacy (non-functional). 

2. Engage Stakeholders in Collaborative Discussions 

Organize requirement review meetings or workshops to facilitate open communication: 

Clarify Objectives: Ensure all parties understand how their requirements align with the project’s goals. 

Encourage Trade-offs: Guide stakeholders to prioritize their needs, identifying areas for compromise. 

Example: Provide a dynamic interface for marketing while implementing back-end security protocols to satisfy the IT team.

SQL Injection 

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 

b. Authentication and Authorization Testing: Validate the system’s mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data: 

Password Policies: Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA). 

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure users can only access data within their role’s scope. 

c. Data Encryption Testing: Verify that financial information is protected during storage and transmission: 

Encryption of Data in Transit: Ensure SSL/TLS encrypts client-server communications. 

Encryption of Data at Rest: Validate that sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) is encrypted using algorithms like AES-256. 

d. Compliance Testing (PCI-DSS): Test for adherence to PCI-DSS standards by verifying: 

Card Data Storage: Confirm that sensitive data such as CVV numbers are not stored. 

Logging and Monitoring: Ensure access to cardholder data is logged and logs are tamper-proof. 

e. Security Regression Testing: Regularly retest the system to ensure new features or code changes do not reintroduce previously fixed vulnerabilities. 

f. Performance Testing Under Load (Denial of Service (DoS) Testing): Test the system’s resilience under heavy traffic to handle high transaction volumes. Use tools like JMeter to simulate DoS attacks. 

g. Compliance with Data Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA): Verify adherence to data privacy regulations by testing for: 

Right to Access and Erasure: Ensure users can access and delete their data as required. 

Informed Consent: Validate that users provide consent for data processing. 

iii. Test Plan Documentation 

Document the entire test plan, including objectives, scope, methodologies, and results for each test. Generate reports after each test cycle to demonstrate compliance with relevant standards. 

Summary 

A robust test plan for a web-based financial system must address vulnerability assessments, authentication, encryption, compliance with standards (e.g., PCI-DSS), and performance testing. By implementing these practices, the system can achieve security compliance, safeguard sensitive information, and maintain user trust.
